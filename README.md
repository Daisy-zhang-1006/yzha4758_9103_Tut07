# Quiz 8 - Imaging and Coding Technique Exploration
## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

**Explanation:**
I have been inspired by the “double exposure techniques in the film “Blade Runner 2049”. This techniques created an dreamed technological atmosphere by semi-transparent superposition the character and background image. I wish to uses this visual manage method in my project to present the combination of virtual and reality that caused by the urbanisation, which is highly consistent with the image construction topic of this project. Here are the pictures in the Blade Runner 2049 that indicate the style this I want to follow with. 
**Example Image:**

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
To achieve the image superposition techniques, I choose the tint( )  and image ( )  functions in p5.js. Through the setting of the transparent level of the second picture and cover it on the first picture can simulate the “double exposure”style like the film present. This method is easily to manipulate, which is the content that we learned in the lesson.  It is suitable for beginners to express the combination between the images and indicate the contrast and sense of memory visual effect. Here are the image that used this code presented.
